# JS-SOLITAIRE

Hello everyone! Recently I made this solitaire game. It has no images, but it is a shippable product and my first foray into card games digital. I personally have not played the real game in like 5 years and I built this game off of the memory of how it works. There are no card images, but text instead. Enjoy!
